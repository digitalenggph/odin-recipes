    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon garlic, chopped</li>         
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger, julienned</li>            
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce (patis)</li>            
        <li>1/2 cup long-grain rice</li>            
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>            
        <li>1/2 piece chicken bouillon cube</li>         
        <li>salt, to taste</li>            
        <li>4-5 eggs</li>          
        <li>spring onions, for garnish</li>           
        <li>8-12 cloves garlic, (minced), for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make lugaw, start off by washing the bigas or uncooked rice. Repeat until the water runs clear, and set it aside. Then, prepare the aromatics: mince the garlic and onion, and julienne the ginger. Set these aside</li>
        <li>In a pot over medium-high heat, add oil. When the oil is hot enough, add the aromatics and saut√© until the onions are translucent. Then, add in patis or fish sauce and the rice. Stir for a few seconds, or until some of the moisture from the uncooked rice has evaporated. Then, add in water or chicken stock. Let the mixture come to a boil, and then lower the heat to reduce to a simmer. Let the rice cook for about 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a smaller pot with water. Let the water boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to let it go down to a simmer. Carefully lower the eggs, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. While waiting, prepare an ice bath. Once the eggs are done cooking, dip them in the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Peel when cool enough to handle.</li>
